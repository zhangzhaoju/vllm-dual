"""Device-only sparse-index preparation for DSA latent scratch (Step B2).

Decode reads the latent through two disjoint index spaces resolved by the SAME
per-request block table:

  * LMCache-selected positions (< cache boundary) -> request-level bitmap union
    scratch rows [0..n_unique), ordered by absolute token position and shared
    by all MTP rows for that request;
  * live-cache positions (>= cache boundary) -> kept ABSOLUTE, read in
    place from their tail blocks. No copy, no [retrieve|decode] assembly.

A zero boundary selects nothing from LMCache and leaves every index absolute.

Everything is fixed-shape tensor math: no D2H sync, graph-mode friendly.

    Args:
        topk_indices: [bs, 1, k] (or [bs, k]) absolute token positions selected
            by the indexer; negative entries are padding.
        split_boundary: [bs] cache split boundary per decode request. Zero
            means the whole prefix is resident in NPU cache. A positive value
            is the LMCache-committed frontier; selected positions below it are
            remapped through the request-level union scratch prefix.
        need_packed: whether to build the LMCache selected-token payload.
        row_req_indices: [bs] request index for each row; negative entries are
            zeroed in the same kernel. Pass this only for pure
            decode/spec-decode; a mixed prefill row also has a negative request
            index but is real.
        local_to_union_workspace: caller-owned fixed-address int32 workspace
            matching ``selected_packed``. Required by the staged path so graph
            replay never allocates temporary storage inside the operator.
        shard_packed_workspace: caller-owned
            ``[requests, 2, 2 * topk]`` int32 workspace for the production
            sharded operator. It is retained at a fixed graph address but not
            accessed by its MTP=1 fast path.
        shard_mapping_workspace: caller-owned workspace matching
            ``shard_packed_workspace`` for dense shard-local ranks.
        shard_counts_workspace: caller-owned ``[requests, 2, 16]`` int32
            workspace. Each shard count owns a separate 64-byte cacheline.
        staged_mtp: enable the fixed-layout production path for pure decode.
            The production sharded operator is used for both supported
            depths: MTP=1 takes its internal compact/single-row-finalize fast
            path without sorting or union, while MTP=2 runs request-sharded
            sort/union. Set ``VLLM_ASCEND_DSA_MTP_SHARDED_SORT=0`` to retain
            the legacy staged operator as a compatibility fallback. Values at
            or above each row's split boundary are ignored by the union and
            remain absolute. Values greater than 2 are not supported.

    Returns:
        new_indices: same shape as topk_indices. LMCache-selected entries are
            replaced by their compact scratch row (scratch_base + rank in
            top-k order); live-cache and padding entries stay unchanged.
        selected_packed: [num_requests, scratch_capacity] int32. Selected
            positions use source order for MTP=1 and sorted union order for
            MTP=2. None when need_packed=False.
