"""Abstraction boundary for the (layerwise) LMCache latent store.

This is the *only* place that depends on the LMCache layerwise API.

Confirmed LMCache load contract (batched per layer, across the decode batch):

    wait_for_layer_load(layer_name: str,
                        selected_tokens: list[int],
                        token_start_index: list[int]) -> None

  * ``layer_name``   : the attention layer to load.
  * ``selected_tokens``: flat list of token positions to gather for the whole batch.
  * ``token_start_index``: per-request start offsets into ``selected_tokens`` (CSR),
    so LMCache knows which flat entries belong to which request.
  * returns nothing: the loaded latent is written into a buffer registered ahead of
    time via :meth:`register_load_buffer` (connector-style, like ``register_kv_caches``).

ASSUMPTION (INTERFACE-VERIFY with the LMCache author): the loaded latent is written
into the registered load buffer **tightly, in ``selected_tokens`` order** — i.e. flat
row ``j`` of the buffer corresponds to ``selected_tokens[j]``. The manager then copies
those rows into the kernel's block-aligned scratch, so this layout assumption is the
only thing that must hold; everything downstream is decoupled from it.

The MLA latent is two tensors on the NPU (``k_nope`` of ``kv_lora_rank`` and ``k_pe``
of ``qk_rope_head_dim``); the manager packs them into one ``latent`` of width
``kv_lora_rank + qk_rope_head_dim`` for transport, and the load buffer holds that
packed layout.

OPEN (pending the LMCache author): the exact **store/save** signature used at prefill
(``save_layer`` below is a placeholder), and whether load is async (it is named
``wait_for_layer_load``, implying it blocks until ready).
